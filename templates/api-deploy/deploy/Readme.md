                - branch = "local"
                - buildCounter = "0"

        - Angular App (Set-Params.ps1 )
            - Accepted Params - (Web Projects) [Listed are      Defaults]
                - projname = (Default  to   your working Project)
                - buildcounter = "0"     
                - branch = "local"
            - Assigns and sets parameters to be used by teamcity based on branch
                - OctopusChannel
                - dockertagprefix
                - buildsuffix
 
- build-push.ps1 
    - #### (Will have specified changes based on App type for passing in Build Parameters from Version.ps1)
    - Accepted Params 
        - branch (used to parse out Jira ID for Tagging)
	    - dockerpath = "Dockerfile.*" (Defaulted to Parse for All Dockerfiles to loop over to build)
	    - dockercontext (Used to Set context to pass into docker at build time)
	    - buildconfiguration = "Debug" (Defaulted for MS Build Type but updated via Set-Params.ps1)
	    - local = "true" (defaulted to true to work for local runs)
	    - OctopusEndpoint (Used to target octopus server for uploading deploy artifact to)
	    - OctopusApiKey (Api Key used to Upload to)
	    - OctopusVersion (Sets version with a more octopus deploy friendly version number)
    - If local defaults to local version, and nulifies the destination docker hosts in favor of local daemon
    - Script checks contents of `Docker`directorylooking for likes structured with `Docker.OperatingSystem` i.e. `Docker.Alpine` and then the script determines which OS to build the container on. If there are multiple dockerfiles the script will foreach over them and run through all of them. 
    - script runs a build and passes arguments for arguments defined in docker file, for things such as `nginxversion`,`npmversion`,`ngversion`,`dotnetframework`, and `dotnet sdk`
    - upon successful build the script will push the image to a container registry and remove the layers used to create it to save room on the local machine (Unless running a local build). 
    - additionally the deploy artifacts will be generated as a product of this script. 
        - a zip containing:
            - version.ps1 for default version values
            - kubernetes/* configuration files for Kubernetes
- version.ps1 [**Please keep track of this file and feel free to update when needed!! Also allows for easy testing of new NG/NPM DotNetSDK/DotNetFramework**]
    -  #### Comes in 2 Flavors, one for Web projects and one for DotnetCore Projects
    -  #### (Angular) Version.ps1 
        - version (Used to default generate local version for container)
        - ngversion (Managed by **DEVELOPERS**) Passes in Desired NG version for container to build with
        - npmversion (Managed by **DEVELOPERS**) Passes in Desired NPM version for container to build, test and restore with
        - nginxversion (Managed by **ALL**) 
    - #### (DotNet) Version.ps1 
        - version (Used to default generate local version for container)
        - dotnetsdk (Managed by **DEVELOPERS**) Passes in Desired Dotnet version for container to build with
        - dotnetframework (Managed by **DEVELOPERS**) Passes in Desired Dotnet Framework version for container to deploy with
    - Values shared by both 
        - imagename (Defaults the docker image name)
        - acr (Azure container registry address)
        - $v is leveraged by other scripts as a default value for some string concatenation

### Docker (Used for Build Environment and Deploy artifact)
- Dockerfile.${YourHostOS}
    - ### DotNetCore Container 
        - Arguments 
            - dotnetsdk - Used to pass in variables to source docker images for dotnetcoresdk
            - dotnetframework - Used to pass in variables to source docker images for dotnetframework
            - buildconfiguration - used to define build config based on branch 
            - nugetfeed - used to define nuget feed used for restore based on branch
        - Copy in SRC directory from working dir 
        - run nuget restore 
        - run dotnet build with appropriate args and runtime based on running OS 
        - run unit tests based on data in the Build Container layer
        - run integration tests based on data in the Build Container Layer
        - Run a dotnet publish 
        - Copy contents from Publish to the new Deploy artifact layer and configure for self hosting 
        - in Self hosting layer we call the startup.sh to run the dotnet app
    - ### Angular Container 
        - Arguments 
            - npmversion - Used to pass in variables setting desired npm version
            - ngversion - Used to pass in variables setting desired angular cli version
            - nginxversion - used to define desired nginxversion
ch
        - Copy in APP directory from working dir and set as container working DIR 
        - run npm install to desired npm version
        - run npm install for desired ng cli 
        - run npm install 
        - Copy Build layer to run Lint against 
        - Copy Build Layer to unit test against
        - Copy Build layer to ng build 
        - Copy built code to nginx and Set Startup.sh for config.json transform
        - Set `ConfigPath` for Startup.sh to know where config file is

### SH script (Used by container to transform config files)
- startup.sh
    - Script defaults to a `ConfigPath` value set in dockerfile
    - nginx or dotnetcore are kicked off to start the application and are set to output to stdout for dockerlogs
